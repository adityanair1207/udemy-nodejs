> All config is done in app.js in an express project.

> API (Application Programming Interface) is a piece of software that is used by another piece of software allowing applications to communicate with each other.

--> REST (Representational State Transfer) Architecture:
> Making web-APIs in a logical way so that they are easy to consume (called RESTful APIs).
> Separate API into logical resources.
> Expose structured, resource-based URLs.
> Use HTTP methods.
> Send data as json (usually).
> Be stateless.

> Methods to support CRUD operations:
POST, GET, PUT (client has to send entire object to be updated), PATCH (only send updated values), DELETE.

> When making POST request in express, to send data along with request, middleware is required. This is because express does not put body data in the request object out-of-the-box.

--> Middleware:
> Executed in the middle of receiving a request and sending a response. Basically everything here is middleware.
> In order to use middleware, we use app.use(). express.json() returns a middleware function which is added to the middleware stack. Hence we did: app.use(express.json());
> Each middleware function has access to request object, response object and next function which is used to switch to the next middleware function in the stack.
> res.status() or res.end() ends the request-response cycle and hence any middleware function that come after these in the middleware stack will not be executed.
> So global middleware functions should be added before route handlers.
> We can write ouw own middleware and add it to the middleware stack using app.use().
> There is a type of middleware called Param Middleware which only runs for certain parameters in the URL.
> In Param Middleware we have access to value of the parameter as the last argument of the middleware function.
> Middleware functions can be chained inside a request method. These run one after the other in order but next() is still required in them.

> Serving static files from a folder: app.use(express.static(`${__dirname}/public`));
> To access it localhost:3000/file_name. Since no such route is defined, the public folder is automatically checked to find the static file.
