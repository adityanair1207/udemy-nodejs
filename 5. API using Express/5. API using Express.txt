> All config is done in app.js in an express project.

> API (Application Programming Interface) is a piece of software that is used by another piece of software allowing applications to communicate with each other.

--> REST (Representational State Transfer) Architecture:
> Making web-APIs in a logical way so that they are easy to consume (called RESTful APIs).
> Separate API into logical resources.
> Expose structured, resource-based URLs.
> Use HTTP methods.
> Send data as json (usually).
> Be stateless.

> Methods to support CRUD operations:
POST, GET, PUT (client has to send entire object to be updated), PATCH (only send updated values), DELETE.

> When making POST request in express, to send data along with request, middleware is required. This is because express does not put body data in the request object out-of-the-box.
