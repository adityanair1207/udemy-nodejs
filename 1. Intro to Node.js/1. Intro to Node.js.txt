> Node.js a js runtime built on Chrome V8.
> Can now be used on server side (back-end) and not only restricted to browser (client).
> Node.js is single-threaded. Based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model.

--> http module:
> http module can be used to create a server and then listen to it from a specific port on an ip (ex: localhost). The server gives a response via a callback function each time it gets hit with a request.
> The callback function has request and response object as its arguments.
> The request object contains among other things headers, method, url. request.url = /, /favicon.ico

--> Routing:
> Express is used to manage complex routing.
> For simple routing, we can use url module.
> The callback function in http.createServer is called twice when hit with a request. request.url is /{path entered} the first time and /favicon.ico the second time. This is done automatically by the browser.
> Using response.writeHead we can return status code along with additional header information.
