npm install mongoose@5

> Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, giving a higher level
of abstraction.

> A model is like a blueprint to create a MongoDB document. To create a model we need a schema.
> Schema is used to set type of data, validation, setting default values.
> Fields not included in schema are ignored when saving to DB.
> Methods called on a model return a Query object. When awaited, we get a document.
> In query string gt, gte, lt, lte can be added like this: duration[gte]=5
> To sort by descending: sort=-price
> To sort by multiple fields: sort=price,ratingsAverage
